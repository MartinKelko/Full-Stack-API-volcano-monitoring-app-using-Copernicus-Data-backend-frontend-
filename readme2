Frontend – Technologies Used

The frontend is implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, and bundled using Vite (fast development server and optimized production build).

Mapping Component

MapLibre GL JS – interactive web mapping (pan, zoom, layers, sources)

Raster basemap: Esri World Imagery (tile service) integrated via a custom MapLibre style JSON

Visualization of AOIs (Areas of Interest) loaded from the backend:

AOI bounding boxes are converted into GeoJSON polygons

AOI centers are rendered as GeoJSON point features (circle layer)

AOI names are displayed as labels (symbol layer) from a defined zoom level

Automatic map fitting to AOI extent using fitBounds

Backend Communication

Uses the native Fetch API

REST endpoints:

/api/health – backend health check

/aois – load Areas of Interest

/api/email-latest-fc-all – trigger email report generation/sending

State Management & UI Logic

React hooks: useEffect, useState, useRef

Interactive UI panel with a “Send email report” button that:

reflects request state (Sending / Sent / Error)

automatically resets after a timeout

Styling

Base styling via maplibre-gl.css

Custom global styles (index.css)

Lightweight inline styling for UI components
